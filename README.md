# colony_sim

The goal of this project was to create a coloney simulation game over teh course of four weeks
as part of my Interactive computer graphics class at Ohio University

#time line

Stage 1:
- Have the gridded map on the screen and be able to highlight and select different grid spaces. 
- Be able to move up and down different levels
- Have the camera up and running.

Stage 2 / two-week milestone:
- Be able to place objects/tasks to do in the world
- Have a basic model for the colonists
- Have colonists that move around 
- Tell the colonist to mine out spaces on the grid

Stage 3:
- Have the colonists be able to transport goods to designated spaces
- At least one object for them to build

Stage 4:
- Have walking animations for the colonists
- Make colonists die from not eating

Each stage was one week. I managed to implement almost all of the features from the time line. I was
not able to get them to transport good from location to location and I was not able to make them die
from lack of food. I did have the trees that would provide lumber and the plnts that would provide food.

I also managed to add controller support, text rendering and the start of a gui.
